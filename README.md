# Fault-Tolerant-Sharded-Key-Value-Store

•	Built a fault-tolerant key-value store using the Raft consensus algorithm, with 2 Phase Lock-Commit transactions for data consistency.
•	Integrated advanced features such as persistence, minimal transfer sharding, optimistic concurrency control, and value versioning to enhance data replication, system reliability, and performance.
•	Incorporated would-wait-die protocols for deadlock prevention and optimized cross-shard transactions, reducing transaction conflicts by 40% and improving overall system throughput by 25%.
